# Store Microservices Archtecture

## What I Learn/Did

1. set up microservices layers; set up java spring boot project by maven; wrap catalog-service; set up workflows for Github Actions; learn Taskfile to replace shell

2. deploy catalog-service to docker; add new commands in Taskfile

3. implement create order api; use records as JPA embeddables; add unit testing controllers using @WebMvcTest; integrate testing by Testcontainers; apply Resilience4j patterns with RestClient (ensuring fault tolerance and graceful degradation in downstream service calls)
